# Random Password Generator

A simple Python program that generates a secure random password using a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user can specify the length of the password, and the script will shuffle and combine the characters to generate the password.

## How the Password Generator Works
- The script uses predefined sets of characters:
  - Lowercase and uppercase alphabets
  - Numbers
  - Special symbols like `@, $, %, ^, &`, and others
- The user inputs the desired length of the password.
- The script shuffles the combined set of characters and selects the specified number of characters to form the password.
